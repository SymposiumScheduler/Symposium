SUMMARY
-------

	The Symposium Scheduler is used to schedule panels that have some 
	constraints on them into venues across time slots. 

	These are the user instructions for running the Symposium Scheduler.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

	In order to run the scheduler, you will need 
	1) Symposium.exe
	2) A properly formatted JSON file containing the necessary information
		(More on this under Input Formatting)


INSTALLATION
------------
	
	Simply double click Symposium.exe to run the algorithm after ensuring 
	all requirements have been met.


INPUT FORMATTING
----------------

	In order for the Rener-Alshakh algorithm to run properly, the user
	must supply a JSON file following the format as described below.
	If there is any confusion, please refer to example_info.txt for an 
	example.

	The formatting should be as follows, noting that 
	1) whitespace is not needed and
	2) replace any word in ALL CAPS by an actual value
	3) "..." indicates that this pattern can go on indefinitely. 
	4) All times (00:00-00:00) are 24-hour based and must always have 4 
		digits seperated by a ":"

CONSTRAINTS
-----------

	For every panel there are 4 assumed constraints:
			
	Panelist constraint: 
	A panelist can’t be assigned to multiple locations at the same time. 
	
	Consecutive Panels Constraint:
	A panelist may not be assigned to three panels that are scheduled very close 
	together.
	
	Preferred Venues Filter:
	This filter is used to order venue times based on priorities given in the 
	input file for each venue. 
	
	Venue Time Duration Filter:
	This filter checks the venue times and increase their score based on the length
	of the venue time. If there are two or fewer panelists on the panel, a short 
	venue time is preferred. If a panel has more than two panelists, a long venue 
	time is preferred.
	
	These are the available constraints that can be added to panels with these 
	exact formats: 
	PRIORITY ranges from 1 to 3. 1 = REQUIRED, 2 = VERY_IMPORTANT, 3 = DESIRED. 
	If a constraint has a priority of REQUIRED that is violated, the panel won’t 
	be scheduled.  As the priority number increases, the importance of the 
	constraint decreases.
	
	What is between the quotes must be put instead of the CONSTRAINT above
			
	“New-Panelist”: This constraint indicates that the panel includes a panelist who
	is new to the conference.
			
	“Paired-Panelists”: This constraint is to prevent any two panelists from 
	appearing together twice or more in a single day.
	
	"Single-Category": This constraint is to prevent any panels having the same 
	category from appearing at the same time.
	 
	“Max-Panels(MAX_NUMBER)”: This constraint is to prevent a panelist from 
	appearing more than the MAX_NUMBER of times per day. MAX_NUMBER should be 
	replaced with a number.
	
	“Min-Panels()”: This filter prioritizes scheduling panelists in days they 
	haven’t been assigned yet.
			
	“Minimum-Capacity(MINIMUM_SIZE)”: This constraint is for the panel to be 
	scheduled at a room with at least size MINIMUM_SIZE. MAX_NUMBER should be 
	replaced with a number.
			
	“Availability”: This constraint is to prevent a panel from being scheduled at a 
	time where one or more panelists on the panel are not available.
			
	“Venue(VENUE_NAME)”: This constraint is to schedule a panel at the given 
	VENUE_NAME. VENUE_NAME must be replaced by the name of the venue, and it must 
	be declared as a venue.
			
	“Time(DAY_NUMBER;00:00)”: This constraint is to schedule a panel at the given 
	time. DAY_NUMBER is the number of the day for the panel to be scheduled at. 


OUTPUT FORMAT
-------------
	
	Once finished, the program will create a json file in the directory it 
	is running from. For reference, the file will follow
	the below format:

	{
		"Scheduled":[
			{
				"Panel":"PANEL_NAME",
					"Messages":[
						"MESSAGE1",
						“MESSAGE2“,
						...
					],
				"Venue":"VENUE_NAME",
				"Time":"DAY_NUMBER, 00:00-00:00"
			},
			{
				"Panel":"PANEL_NAME",
					"Messages":[
						"MESSAGE1",
						“MESSAGE2“,
						...
					],
				"Venue":"VENUE_NAME",
				"Time":"DAY_NUMBER, 00:00-00:00"
			},
			...
		],
		“Messages”:[ 
			"MESSAGE1",
			“MESSAGE2“,
			... 
		],	
		"Unscheduled":[
			{
				"Panel":"PANEL_NAME",
				"Messages":[
					"MESSAGE1",
					“MESSAGE2“,
					...
				]
			},
			{
				"Panel":"PANEL_NAME",
				"Messages":[
					"MESSAGE1",
					“MESSAGE2“,
					...
				]
			},
			...
		]
		"Underutilized_Panelists":{
			"PANELISTS_NAME":[DAY_NUMBER1, DAY_NUMBER2, ... ],
			"PANELISTS_NAME":[DAY_NUMBER1, DAY_NUMBER2, ... ],
			...
		}
	}


	Note that the messages given in the output are error related, or explain 
	unnecessary constraints that were violated, and why.
